# maq_LUT_generator
 Create LUTs with monotonically increasing luminance by defining just a few parameters.

This is an adaptation of the notebook written by Kenneth Moreland (Website: http://www.kennethmoreland.com/; GitHub: https://github.com/kmorel). It was originally made to generate color maps that have a monotonic increase in luminance. In other words, the brightness increases linearly as you cycle through the hues of your choice. I have kept in most of the notes from Moreland because I found it very helpful to understand the functions as well as thinking about LUTs in the HSV space. Another helpful explanation can be found here: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hsv-color-model-in-computer-graphics/ . All notes written by Quintanilla for the adaptation will begin with "MQ:"
